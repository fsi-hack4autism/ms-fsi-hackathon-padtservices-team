   Future goal is to perfrom CART Analysis using decision trees to improve clustering results and utilize more features. 
   Intial focus was to get a basic model set up to answer, the question 
   
   #### Can we determine patterns in skill acquisition which can help segment and benchmark?  and 
   #### Can we find commonalities among cases to create segments and find benchmarks based on looking at the data alone?
